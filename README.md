# Virtual Pet

I created a TDD for Virtual Pet, the pupose is to get the expected results that is initated in the VirtualPet.Java.
Once the TDD passes successfully and I then prepared my VirturalPetApplication.
In my application I have included a Scanner to receive input.
Also in my application I included ASCII Art, a picture of a pet.
Next I included options that the user can choose from to take care of their pet.
The Options are 1-5 that include if the pet is hungry, thirsty, boredom, tiredness, and not feeling well.
In the Virtual Pet I have included a Thread.Sleep code, because once the user picks the option they want, there is a 3 second response time.
Once user is done playing the game the user can exit, by pressing option 6 from the choices that is provided
